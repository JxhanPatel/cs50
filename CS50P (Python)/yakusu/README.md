# Yakusu
## A Japanese Kanji Translator - Harvard's CS50P Final Project

### Why Yakusu?
Learning Japanese presents several challenges, particularly when it comes to mastering its intricate writing system, with two sets of alphabets (Hiragana and Katakana) and the formidable realm of kanji characters. With thousands of symbols to memorize, each representing unique concepts and words, navigating Japanese text can be daunting for learners. To address this complexity and aid language enthusiasts on their learning journey, the Python program "Yakusu" emerges as a valuable companion. Yakusu offers a versatile text of functionalities designed to streamline the process of understanding and translating Japanese text. Leveraging web scraping techniques, Yakusu enables users to search for kanji characters based on input words, providing meanings and readings sourced from the popular databases of websites like Jisho.org, tangorin.com. Additionally, Yakusu facilitates the conversion of kanji characters into romaji, (the Latin alphabet representation of Japanese sounds) aiding learners in grasping pronunciation. Furthermore, the program supports the conversion of romaji into hiragana, the foundational Japanese phonetic script crucial for basic reading and writing. For users seeking translation from Japanese to English, Yakusu seamlessly integrates the Google Translate API, enabling real-time translation between Japanese and English too.
